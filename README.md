# Pandas Refresher for Machine Learning

This repository is a personal review of **pandas**, based on the material I previously studied in college during my **Machine Learning and Data Science** courses.

The purpose of this project is to refresh my knowledge of pandas, strengthen my understanding of core concepts, and rebuild confidence in working with data before moving on to more advanced machine learning tasks.

## About this repository

While studying machine learning in college, I learned how to use pandas for data analysis and data preparation. Over time, I realized that strong fundamentals are essential for writing clean, efficient, and reliable code. This repository is my way of revisiting pandas from the ground up and practicing it in a structured way.

The focus is not on learning pandas for the first time, but on **reviewing and reinforcing concepts** that are critical for real-world machine learning workflows.
